# Overview #

The Rapid Inventory Collection System (RICS), developed at [Geoscience Australia](http://www.ga.gov.au), is used to capture geo-tagged imagery and collect geo-tagged notes of built environments. Up to four high resolution GigE cameras capture images that are then displayed on the RICS Graphical User Interface and saved in the JPEG format. It is typically used for building and infrastructure damage assessment following a natural disaster.

In particular, RICS:

  * Complements and augments the detailed field damage assessments (house-to-house and structure-to-structure) currently undertaken during post-event impact assessments using hand-held Personal Data Assistants;
  * Provides a quick 'first-look' of the damage impact area to prioritise the worst-hit regions for detailed surveys;
  * Permits 100% coverage of building damage in a disaster-affected area (provided vehicular access is available);
  * Collects data focusing on 'population coverage' and in disaster situations quickly collects information on undamaged structures allowing engineering and GIS staff to focus on damaged structures; and
  * Allows fieldwork (damage assessment) to be undertaken more efficiently.

RICS was deployed following the 2009 Victorian Bushfires, the 2010 Kalgoorlie and Christchurch Earthquakes, 2011 Brisbane floods and Tropical Cyclone Yasi to collect geo-tagged imagery of structures and buildings. It was deployed recently to capture ge-tagged imagery of the Darling River in New South Wales for ecological research.

The software was developed for Microsoft Windows and has been tested on Windows XP, Vista and 7 (32 and 64 bits). It is multi-threaded and written in C++ using wxWidgets, Boost and SQLite.
