# Installation #

## Building from Source ##

The RICS source code and the binary installer is available from Google Code http://code.google.com/p/rics/. A Microsoft Visual 2008 VCPROJ file is provided. Please refer to the README.txt file for information on building and installing the software from source.

## Binary Installer ##

Double click the self-install file rics-<version number>.msi. This will install RICS and the Allied Vision System (AVT) GigE Filter and GigE Viewer self-installation files. The installation of the Viewer and the Filter are optional but it is highly recommended that both are installed. The Viewer can be used to focus the cameras and set various camera parameters as it can display a larger view of the captured images than RICS. The Filter offloads some of the gigabit Ethernet data handling and reduces the CPU loading. For more information please visit the Allied Vision Technologies website.

To uninstall the software, follow the procedure below:

  1. In the **Windows Control Panel** window, click **Add/Remove Programs**.
  1. Highlight **Rapid Inventory Collection System** and click **Change/Remove** button.
  1. Repeat step 2 for the AVT GigEViewer and Filter.
